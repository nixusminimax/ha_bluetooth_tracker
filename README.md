Tell Homeassistent if someone from the family is home

This script isnt designed to run in your HA Environment!
It should run outside because of you may have more than one "scanner Servers but only one HA Server.
In my case i even run mosquitto outside of HA because i dont like hassio and that the developers want to decide (press on) what versions i run and when i had to upgrade to their latest "beta".
That way i can do whatever i want on HA and my tasmota devices didnt lost their MQTT Server while i am dong maintenance.
